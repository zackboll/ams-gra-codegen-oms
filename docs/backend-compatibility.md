# Backend compatibility and Task 017 baseline

Tested: **2026-09-18**, baseline `1fa2ab4d380158728d383a5e4fbaebea6a2006b1`.

This document records backend status separately from frontend compatibility.
The authoritative schemas remain external and are not vendored. The frontend
fully normalizes the UCI 2.5 and UCI 2.6 roots; the three language backends do
not yet generate those complete models.

Reproduce the deterministic analyzer output with:

```bash
ams-gra-codegen-oms coverage --schema /path/to/UCI_MessageDefinitions_v2_N_0.xsd
```

## Metric definitions

- **Kind renderable:** the declaration's `TypeKind` has a renderer, ignoring
  constraints, abstractness, inheritance, and member details.
- **Declaration fully renderable:** the current backend can render the complete
  declaration without discarding base, abstract, constraint, member type, or
  occurrence semantics.
- **Field type renderable:** the field/alternative's immediate `TypeRef` can be
  named or mapped to a currently supported primitive. It does not imply that a
  named target's declaration is fully renderable.
- **Field occurrence renderable:** cardinality and nillability can be represented
  by the current backend. This metric is intentionally separate from type and
  constraint support.
- **Message closure renderable:** the immediate payload and every declaration in
  its transitive named dependency closure are fully renderable. Dependencies
  include bases, aliases, record fields, choice alternatives, and list items.
  Cycles and missing declarations fail closed.

| Choice | 420 | 424 |
| List | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **5,557** | **5,570** |

| Declaration property | UCI 2.5 | UCI 2.6 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Abstract | 70 | 70 |
| Concrete | 5,487 | 5,500 |
| Any `base_type` | 2,971 | 2,970 |
| Structural named base | 2,026 | 2,036 |
| Named simple restriction base | 23 | 25 |
| Primitive simple restriction base | 922 | 909 |
| Forward base reference | 898 | 901 |
| Backward base reference | 1,151 | 1,160 |

## Structural inheritance

| Shape | UCI 2.5 | UCI 2.6 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Record with Record base | 2,025 | 2,035 |
| Record with Choice base | 0 | 0 |
| Choice with Record base | 1 | 1 |
| Choice with Choice base | 0 | 0 |
| References to abstract bases | 1,270 | 1,273 |
| References to concrete bases | 756 | 763 |
| Structural roots | 2,586 | 2,600 |
| Distinct declarations used as bases | 271 | 272 |
| Maximum inheritance edge depth | 5 | 5 |
| Empty local Record extensions | 406 | 405 |
| Non-empty local Record extensions | 1,619 | 1,630 |
| Local Choice extensions | 1 | 1 |

No inherited field redeclarations, inherited choice-name redeclarations,
record/choice cross-level name collisions, or other repeated member names were
found in either release. The projection rejects such collisions with a
structured error; it does not rename silently.

## Fields and choices

| Inventory | UCI 2.5 | UCI 2.6 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Record fields | 11,692 | 11,716 |
| Choice alternatives | 1,468 | 1,482 |
| Named references | 11,931 | 12,044 |
| Required `1..1` | 5,883 | 5,919 |
| Optional `0..1` | 4,949 | 4,967 |
| Finite repeated | 395 | 360 |
| Unbounded repeated | 1,933 | 1,952 |
| `minOccurs > 1` | 16 | 16 |
| Nillable true | 0 | 0 |
| Nillable false | 13,160 | 13,198 |
| Local field constraints present | 466 | 469 |
| Field `minInclusive` | 466 | 469 |
| Field `maxInclusive` | 466 | 469 |
| Other field constraint families | 0 | 0 |

| Primitive member reference | UCI 2.5 | UCI 2.6 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Boolean | 409 | 349 |
| SignedInteger | 80 | 82 |
| UnsignedInteger | 386 | 387 |
| Decimal | 0 | 0 |
| Float32 | 56 | 56 |
| Float64 | 280 | 280 |
| String | 0 | 0 |
| Binary | 5 | 0 |
| DateTime | 4 | 0 |
| Time | 0 | 0 |
| Duration | 9 | 0 |

Both releases have 47 choices with duplicate payload types and 113 additional
alternatives sharing a payload type. Names remain unique: duplicate alternative
names are zero. Repeated alternatives number 93/94, nillable alternatives are
zero, and 419/423 choices are standalone. `QueryType` is the sole inherited
choice.

## Abstract-type usage

The 70 abstract structural declarations have the same usage distribution in
both releases. Categories overlap because one declaration may have several use
sites.

| Usage | UCI 2.5 | UCI 2.6 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Used as a base | 57 | 57 |
| Base only | 18 | 18 |
| Referenced by Record field | 43 | 43 |
| Referenced by Choice alternative | 15 | 15 |
| Message payload | 0 | 0 |
| List item | 0 | 0 |
| Alias/other named reference | 0 | 0 |

Abstract declarations are therefore not base-only, even though no global
message directly names an abstract payload.

## Structural projection

`codegen-core` exposes `EffectiveStructuralType`, containing the target,
immediate base, base-to-derived `StructuralLevel` ancestry, and ordered borrowed
`StructuralSegment`s. A segment is either `RecordFields(&[FieldDecl])` or
`ChoiceAlternatives(&[FieldDecl])` and retains its owning declaration. All field
semantics and source provenance remain in the borrowed `FieldDecl`.

Empty local segments are omitted from `segments` but retained in `ancestry`.
Thus an empty derived Record still has its base's effective content and retains
its own identity, kind, and abstract flag. Missing/non-structural bases, cycles,
primitive structural bases, and inherited name collisions return structured
errors.

Synthetic CI tests cover standalone Record and Choice, three-level Records,
Record-to-Choice, Choice-to-Record, empty extension, forward-declared base,
abstract base metadata, malformed state, and collision rejection.

### Maximum-depth representative

Both releases project identically:

```text
DataRecordBaseType       Record 1
DataRecordListBaseType   Record 0
RecordDRLE               Record 0
AirRecordDRLE            Record 1
AirRecordDRL             Record 1
AirRecordMDT             Record 2
```

Ancestry has six declarations (five inheritance edges). Empty segments are
omitted, producing four effective Record segments and five effective members.

### Mixed-compositor representative

Both releases project `QueryPET -> QueryType` as:

```text
QueryPET   Record 0
QueryType  Choice 15
```

The effective sequence contains one 15-alternative Choice segment. The empty
Record remains in ancestry; the alternatives are never flattened into fields.

## Current backend baseline

All six pre-change authoritative generation probes first fail on:

```text
unsupported <language> IR construct: inherited structural type AccessAssessmentID_Type
```

This is the first structural-inheritance blocker for Ada, Rust, and C++ in both
releases. First-failure order is not treated as a coverage percentage.

### UCI 2.5

| Backend | Kind | Full declaration | Field type | Field occurrence | Message closure |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Ada | 4,921/5,557 (88.55%) | 1,062/5,557 (19.11%) | 12,011/13,160 (91.27%) | 6,183/13,160 (46.98%) | 0/722 (0.00%) |
| Rust | 4,921/5,557 (88.55%) | 1,753/5,557 (31.55%) | 12,011/13,160 (91.27%) | 11,227/13,160 (85.31%) | 0/722 (0.00%) |
| C++ | 4,921/5,557 (88.55%) | 1,753/5,557 (31.55%) | 12,011/13,160 (91.27%) | 11,227/13,160 (85.31%) | 0/722 (0.00%) |

### UCI 2.6

| Backend | Kind | Full declaration | Field type | Field occurrence | Message closure |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Ada | 4,928/5,570 (88.47%) | 1,051/5,570 (18.87%) | 12,126/13,198 (91.88%) | 6,185/13,198 (46.86%) | 0/725 (0.00%) |
| Rust | 4,928/5,570 (88.47%) | 1,765/5,570 (31.69%) | 12,126/13,198 (91.88%) | 11,246/13,198 (85.21%) | 0/725 (0.00%) |
| C++ | 4,928/5,570 (88.47%) | 1,765/5,570 (31.69%) | 12,126/13,198 (91.88%) | 11,246/13,198 (85.21%) | 0/725 (0.00%) |

Current common capabilities are bounded SignedInteger declarations, enums,
simple Records, named references, SignedInteger/String primitive references,
selected optional/finite repeated cardinalities, and dependency ordering. Ada's
occurrence subset is narrower than Rust/C++. Unsupported families include
abstract structure, structural inheritance, Choice, most primitive references,
general/unbounded cardinality, nillability, and unsupported declaration/member
constraints. Runtime regex and temporal parsing remain explicitly out of scope.

## Hypothetical feature impact

For each backend and release, enabling any one family alone unblocks **zero**
complete message closures:

| Hypothetical family | UCI 2.5 | UCI 2.6 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Primitive declarations/references only | 0 | 0 |
| General cardinality/nillability only | 0 | 0 |
| Choice only | 0 | 0 |
| Structural inheritance/abstract only | 0 | 0 |
| Constrained simple types only | 0 | 0 |

The analyzer exhaustively evaluates all 31 non-empty combinations. Every proper
subset still unblocks zero complete closures; enabling all five hypothetically
unblocks 722/722 in 2.5 and 725/725 in 2.6. Results match across Ada, Rust, and
C++ for closure impact even though their declaration and occurrence baselines
differ.

This demonstrates strong transitive coupling, not that every feature has equal
priority. The recommended next tranche is **structural inheritance plus abstract
type lowering**: it is the universal first blocker, affects 2,026/2,036
declarations, and now has a shared compositor-preserving projection. Choice is
the next interacting structural tranche. No lowering was added in Task 017.

## Non-goals retained

Task 017 does not add backend inheritance, abstract, Choice, or scalar lowering;
does not flatten inherited members; and does not add JSON/serde, OWP, CAL
runtime, regex execution, temporal parsing, or Task 018 implementation.
